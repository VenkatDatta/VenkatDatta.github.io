  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={QoS Aware Resource Management for Apache Cassandra},
  year={2016},  
  volume={},  
  number={},  
  pages={3-10},  
  abstract={Apache Cassandra is a distributed database of choice when it comes to big data management with zero downtime, linear scalability, and seamless multiple data center deployment. However, resource allocation for the system during deployment is a major issue which could either lead to bad performance or under-utilization of resources. In this paper we describe a QoS-aware architecture that manages resources for the distributed storage system to proactively and dynamically allocate resources for the distributed storage system to ensure that effective resource utilization and deliver performance according to the specified QoS. The architecture uses machine learning techniques to proactively predict and judge the performance of the system and make decisions for effective resource management for the database. In addition, we propose an adaptive sampling mechanism for classification to ensure that the architecture does not impose an unreasonable overhead on the system. We evaluate and provide results using Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) on the modified Cassandra cluster. Our evaluation shows an increase of the overall utilization of the allocated resources without compromising on the required QoS latency for the overall cluster.},
