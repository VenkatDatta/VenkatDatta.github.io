I am a software engineer with 4+ years of experience. I love the logical side of building things. I live for the thrill/feeling after solving complex challenges. I have been exposed to a variety of languages such as C++, Java, Python and Javascript.

I'm also passionate towards latest research in the Cloud Computing domain. I spend my time reading few of the interesting research in the fields and capture my views.

I do the work I do because I love it. I like the people I meet. I embrace the nerd. I like to make the web a better place. Hopefully we cross paths in the real world someday and we can make it a better place together.
